# Rules

Rules is a collection of exercises that cover a variety of topics in UI design, from creating grids and organizing multi-state elements to improving accessibility and designing consistent UI elements. The goal of this project is to help you develop a better understanding of UI patterns, accessibility principles, and design consistency.
Below is a breakdown of each subtopic, including how I approached the exercises and what I learned from them.

## Grids

In this exercise, I explored the use of grids in UI design. I analyzed different images and identified aligned elements across the screen. By drawing grids in Figma, I gained a deeper understanding of how designers use grid structures to maintain consistency and clarity in their layouts. The goal was to highlight the importance of visual alignment in ensuring that users can easily interpret the structure of a digital product at first glance.

**Key Takeaway**: Grids help in creating a balanced layout, making it easier for users to navigate and consume information.

## Multi-state Elements

For this task, I focused on identifying multi-state elements across various websites. A multi-state element changes its appearance or behavior in response to user interactions such as hover, click, or focus. I observed and documented five different combinations of these elements on Sony's website, learning how visual feedback can be used to enhance user engagement and improve usability.

**Key Takeaway**: Multi-state elements provide users with interactive feedback, offering clarity and guidance throughout their interactions.

## Accessibility (Website)

In this exercise, I reviewed accessible websites to identify concrete examples of how accessibility is integrated into design. I explored three different websites and documented measures such as color contrast, enlarged text on hover, and distinct link colors. These accessibility features are crucial in making content more readable and perceivable for all users, including those with visual impairments.

**Key Takeaway**: Accessibility measures help make websites more inclusive and easier to navigate for users with different needs.

## Accessibility (App)

Similar to the website accessibility exercise, this task involved exploring apps and identifying accessibility features that improve usability. I documented examples from three different apps, focusing on aspects like button sizes, readable fonts, and clear contrast. These features ensure that users with disabilities can interact with the app without facing unnecessary challenges.

**Key Takeaway**: Accessibility measures are not just about meeting legal requirementsâ€”they are vital for creating a positive user experience for everyone.

## Breadcrumbs

In this task, I explored the use of breadcrumbs in websites and apps. Breadcrumbs are a navigation tool that helps users understand where they are within a site or app. I collected screenshots of breadcrumb elements from five different websites, focusing on their design and functionality. This task highlighted the role of breadcrumbs in improving navigation and providing context within complex sites.

**Key Takeaway**: Breadcrumbs improve navigation and provide users with clear context of their location within a website or app.

## Toggle Buttons

Toggle buttons are used to switch between two states, often represented as on/off or active/inactive. I found five examples of toggle buttons from different websites and apps, documenting how they were used in various interfaces. This exercise reinforced the importance of clear, intuitive controls for switching between options.

**Key Takeaway**: Toggle buttons should be designed to be easily recognizable and provide immediate feedback to the user.

## Radio Buttons

Radio buttons allow users to select a single option from a group of choices. I explored various implementations of radio buttons on different platforms, looking at their design and usage. This task helped me understand how radio buttons are used in forms and surveys to gather user preferences.

**Key Takeaway**: Radio buttons should be clearly labeled and designed to allow easy selection of one option from multiple choices.

## Calendars

For this exercise, I analyzed different calendar designs on websites and apps. I found five examples of calendars, each with unique features and layouts. This exercise taught me the importance of calendar UI elements in scheduling and planning, as they need to be both functional and easy to use.

**Key Takeaway**: Calendar designs should be intuitive, easy to read, and provide quick access to relevant dates and events.

## Time Pickers

Similar to the calendar task, I explored time pickers across various apps and websites. Time pickers allow users to select specific times, and I documented five different designs. This helped me understand how time pickers need to provide clear, structured options to avoid confusion during user input.

**Key Takeaway**: Time pickers should offer a smooth and precise user experience, with a layout that allows quick selection of hours, minutes, and seconds.

## Micro-interactions

Micro-interactions are small, subtle animations or feedback mechanisms that provide users with real-time information. I explored five examples of feedback micro-interactions across different platforms, focusing on their role in guiding users through tasks and giving instant feedback.

**Key Takeaway**: Micro-interactions are an essential part of the user experience, providing immediate feedback and ensuring users feel in control of their interactions.

## Consistency

In this exercise, I explored the concept of design consistency across a website or app. I focused on identifying five signs of consistency, such as uniform button styles, consistent color schemes, and similar layouts across pages. This helped reinforce the idea that consistency plays a crucial role in creating a cohesive and intuitive user experience.

**Key Takeaway**: Consistency in design improves user understanding and makes the interface more predictable and easier to navigate.
